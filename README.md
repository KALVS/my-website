Howdy partner.

This is my website. I built it, all by myself.

Built using Vue and Nuxt
Its all typescript. Typesafety is like a seat belt in a racecar.

Feel free to clone and run it yourself with the old 
'npm i && npm run dev'

Got lambda integration for Stripe and AWS SNS.
Uses GitHub Actions to deploy to s3 and invalidate Cloudfront cache.

If you read something strange or think I'm doing it wrong, please, please, please say something.
We're all meant to win together.

Thanks for visiting!
